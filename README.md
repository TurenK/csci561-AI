AI algorithms -- CSCI 561 by Prof. Shen, Wei-min

**Language :** Python 3.6.4

**Tools :** only basic libraries of Python (No third-party libraries)

## Path in a 3D Maze

**Structure :** 
- BFS - Breadth-first Search
- UCS - Uniform-cost Search
- A Star Search - Heuristic: Euclidean distance
	
**Test :** on several mazes; find the shortest path from entrance to exit

## Go game
Go game with a board only 5 X 5

**Structure :** 
- host - create the board, check validation of both side, and judge win or not
- my_player - my minimax player
- grader_player - grader players
	
**Test :** my_player test with random player, greedy player, aggressive player, minimax player, Q-learning player and a championship player; relative good performance
